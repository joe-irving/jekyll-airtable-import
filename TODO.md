# Stuff still to do

* URL field not pulling through with collection import
* Update linker to not rely on field name matching collection name
* Assign an `airtable_id` field for each collection/data item because id
  is a field already used sometimes.
* Check dependencies are correct - and not overly strict

# Bugs

* Do not accept slug feild if is lookup
* For some reason collection only working if collection: true
* Only run linker if import succeeds
